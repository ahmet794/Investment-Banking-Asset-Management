    "# An Introduction to the Black-Litterman in Python\n",

    "The Black-Litterman asset allocation model \\cite{black1992global}, \\cite{he1999intuition} provides a methodical way of combining an investors subjective views of the future performance of a risky investment asset with the views implied by the market equilibrium. The method has seen wide acceptance amongst practitioners as well as academics in spite of the fact that it originated as an internal Goldman Sachs working paper, rather than as a piece of research from academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black Litterman procedure can be viewed as a bayesian shrinkage method, that shrinks the expected returns constructed from an investor's views on asset returns towards asset returns implied by the market equilibrium. The procedure computes a set of expected returns that uses the market equilibrium implied  as a prior. This is then combined with returns implied by subjective investor views to produce a set of posterior expected returns $\\mu^{BL}$ and covariances $\\Sigma^{BL}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the obvious attraction of being able to incorporate subjective investor views, the Black-Litterman procedure has a second feature that makes it extremely attractive to portfolio optimization. It is well known that the Markowitz optimization procedure is highly sensitive to estimation errors in Expected Returns and Covariances, and this _error maximizing_ nature of the Markowitz procedure causes unstable portfolios with extreme weights that diverge rapidly from the market equilibrium portfolio even with minor changes to the inputs (e.g. \\cite{chopra1993effect}, \\cite{michaud1989markowitz}). However, the posterior parameters $\\mu^{BL}, \\Sigma^{BL}$ computed by the Black Litterman procedure are derived in part from the market portfolio, and therefore are much more pragmatic inputs for purposes of portfolio optimization. Specifically, when $\\mu^{BL}, \\Sigma^{BL}$ as used as as inputs to a Markowitz Optimizer, they produce optimized weights that diverge from the market portfolio in limited ways, and only to the extent of the confidence that the investor expresses in the views. Consequently the optimized portfolios are more stable portfolios than with pure Markowitz optimization with sample estimates. In the extreme, with appropriately set parameters, the Markowitz portfolio computed from the Black-Litterman parameters when there are no subjective investor views exactly coincides and is able to recover the market equilibrium portfolio."
