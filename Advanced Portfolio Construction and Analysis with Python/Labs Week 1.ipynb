    "\n",
    "**Capital Asset Pricing Model** CAPM is a financial model to evaluate the expected return of an asset. It provides a framework for understanding the relationship between the asset's risk and its expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAPM considers market risk to be the primary determinant of an asset's expected return.\n",
    "- Market risk is measured by beta, which represents the asset's sensitivity to market movements.\n",
    "- The CAPM formula is: E(X) = risk free rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk Free Rate)\n",
    "- The **risk free rate** represents the return on a risk free investment, for example; government bonds.\n",
    "- The CAPM model helps investors determine if the asset value is undervalued or overvalued. \n",
